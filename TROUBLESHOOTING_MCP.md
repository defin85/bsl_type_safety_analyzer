# Troubleshooting MCP Server - BSL Type Safety Analyzer

## Problem
MCP server successfully compiles and runs, but no tools are visible to MCP clients.

## Investigation Results

### 1. Server Implementation
- Using rmcp v0.1.5 (non-official Rust MCP SDK)
- Server starts successfully and loads the BSL index
- ServerHandler trait is implemented correctly
- `#[tool(tool_box)]` macro is applied to impl block

### 2. Comparison with Working Example
- mcp_metadata_analyzer project uses the same rmcp version and works correctly
- Structure is almost identical between projects
- Both use `#[tool(tool_box)]` on impl blocks with tool methods

### 3. Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Added rmcp with "server" feature - didn't help
2. ✅ Removed "server" feature (like in working example) - didn't help
3. ✅ Created v2 server with all code in one file - didn't help
4. ✅ Fixed Send/Sync trait issues - server runs but still no tools

### 4. Test Results
```
Available tools: 0
```

Despite server running and loading index successfully, MCP client cannot see any tools.

## Possible Causes

1. **rmcp Macro Expansion Issue**: The `#[tool(tool_box)]` macro might not be expanding correctly due to:
   - Module structure (tools in separate module)
   - Import conflicts
   - Macro hygiene issues

2. **Version Mismatch**: Client using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.17.1 might have compatibility issues with rmcp 0.1.5

3. **Registration Problem**: Tools might not be automatically registered with the server

## Next Steps

1. **Debug Macro Expansion**: Add explicit debug output in tool methods to verify they're being called
2. **Try Official SDK**: Consider switching from rmcp to the official modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk
3. **Simplify Further**: Create absolute minimal example with just one tool
4. **Check rmcp Examples**: Look for working examples in rmcp repository

## Working Example Structure (mcp_metadata_analyzer)
```rust
#[tool(tool_box)]
impl OneCAnalyzer {
    #[tool(description = "...")]
    pub async fn load_configuration(&self, #[tool(param)] path: String) -> String {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

## Our Structure (Identical but not working)
```rust
#[tool(tool_box)]
impl BslTypeAnalyzer {
    #[tool(description = "...")]
    pub async fn load_configuration(&self, #[tool(param)] config_path: String, ...) -> String {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

The mystery continues...
